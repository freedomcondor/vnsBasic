This is a little testbench for our first vns demo

Among these files, three are the most important
	experiment.argos is the .argos xml file
	quadcopter.lua and vehicle.lua are the controller file

Apart from these three files, there are two other files
	1. PackageInterface.lua
		It provides functions to transform a table of numbers into a table of Bytes and vise-versa
		in order to enable the radio contact

		example:	
			a = {1, 2.3, -4,55, 7}
			b = tableToBytes(a)
			transmit(b)	   
				-- transmit() is to transmit bytes, in our case it is
						robot.radios["radio_0"].tx_data()

			----------------------------------------------
			b = receive()
				-- receive() is to receive bytes, in our case it is
						robot.radios["radio_0"].rx_data[i]
			a = bytesToTable(b)
			then a will be {1, 2.3, -4,55, 7}

	2. debugger.lua
		This is a lua debugger, it will be usefull in a lot of cases
		To use it, just require("debugger") at the beginning of a lua file
		and then you will see the program pauses at the first line when lua starts to run
		and then you will be able to give a command to the debugger

		It has some basic operations:
			r      :            keep running the rest discard all the breakpoint
			c      :            keep running but pause at the next breakpoint
			n or just Enter :   step over line by line
			s      :            step in
			b 14   :            set a breakpoint at line 14
			p a[1] :            print variable a[1]
			q      :            quit the program
		there are some other operations that are not listed here, but 
		you can check them out in debugger.lua
